Somebody ought to do something, or we shall all be destroyed."</p><p>He was caned for untruthfulness without any delay. His master was never one for postponing a duty.</p><p>"But it's true," said Edmund. "You just see if it isn't."</p><p>He pointed out of the window, and everyone could see a vast yellow cloud rising up into the air above the mountain.</p><p>"It's only a thunder shower," said the master, and caned Edmund more than ever.
