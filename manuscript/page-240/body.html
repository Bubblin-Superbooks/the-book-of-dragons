He sleeps under the root of this tree. I use him to light my fire with."</p><p>And, sure enough, there under the tree was the dragon on a nest of scorched moss, and he was about as long as your finger.</p><p>"How can I kill him?" asked the Prince.</p><p>"I don't know that you can kill him," said Elfin, "but you can take him away if you've brought anything to put him in. That bottle of yours would do."</p><p>So between them they managed, with bits of stick and by singeing their fingers a little, to poke and shove the dragon till they made it creep into the silver hunting bottle, and then the Prince screwed on the top tight.</p></div> </div>
