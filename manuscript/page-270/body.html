There was a brass plate on the door that said mrs. d. knock and ring, and a white label that said call me at three. Edmund had a watch: It had been given to him on his birthday two days before, and he had not yet had time to take it to pieces and see what made it go, so it was still going. He looked at it now.

Then he knocked and rang, and there was a rattling and puffing inside. The great door flew open, and Edmund had only just time to hide behind it when out  came an immense yellow dragon, who wriggled off down the brass cave like a long, rattling wormâ€”or perhaps more like a monstrous centipede.</p></div> </div>
