How would you like to be eaten yourself?"</p><p>"Not at all," the dragon confessed, "but nobody will eat me."</p><p>"I don't know," said Johnnie, "there's a giant—"</p><p>"I know. I fought with him, and licked him."</p><p>"Yes, but there's another come now—the one you fought was only this one's little boy. This one is half as big again."</p><p>"He's seven times as big," said Tina.</p><p>"No, nine times," said Johnnie. "He's bigger than the steeple."</p><p>"Oh, dear," said the dragon. "I never expected this."</p><p>"And the mayor has told him where you are," Tina went on, "and he is coming to eat you as soon as he has sharpened his big knife. The mayor told him you were a wild dragon—but he didn't mind. He said he only ate wild dragons—with bread sauce."</p></div> </div>
