<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Harry and Effie could see the country below, hedges  and rivers and churches and farmhouses flowing away from under them, much faster than you see them running away from the sides of the fastest express train.</p><p>And still the dragon flew on. The children saw other dragons in the air as they went, but the dragon who was as big as the dining room never stopped to speak to any of them, but just flew on quite steadily.</p><p>"He knows where he wants to go," said Harry. "Oh, if he would only drop us before he gets there!"</p><p>But the dragon held on tight, and he flew and flew and flew until at last, when the children were quite giddy, he settled down, with a rattling of all his scales, on the top of a mountain. And he lay there on his great green scaly side, panting, and very much out of breath, because he had come such a long way. But his claws were fast in Effie's sash and the little point at the back of Harry's Eton jacket.</p></div> </div>
