She had never been out of her tower before, and the soft grass under her feet felt like grass of Paradise.</p><p>She ran right into the thickest part of the wood, because she did not know what her heart was made of, and she was afraid of the dragon, and there in a dell she came on Elfin and his five and seventy fine pigs. He was playing his flute, and around him the pigs were dancing cheerfully on their hind legs.</p><p>"Oh, dear," said the Princess, "do take care of me. I am so frightened."</p><p>"I will," said Elfin, putting his arms around her. "Now you are quite safe. What were you frightened of?"</p></div> </div>
